# The ADAN Programming Language
ADAN is an object oriented, turing complete programming language written in C by [Lily](https://github.com/transicle), [Leo](https://github.com/wawkne), and [Kauht](https://github.com/kauht) that strives to introduce a strict and safe type system that primarily focuses on preventing memory leaks and vulnerable or unstable code. Derived from [ADA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)), which was typically used for aerospace engineering. Our goal with the ADAN language is to provide more modern syntax whilst keeping ADA's safety.

The ADAN language is open for contributions. If you have found a bug and you would like to fix it, or you would like to make optimizations to our code, open a pull request, and it will be reviewed as soon as possible.
