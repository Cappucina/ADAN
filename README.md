ADAN is a statically typed, memory safe programming language that strives to introduce a strict and safe type system that primarily focuses on preventing possible memory leaks and unstable code. ADAN has syntax similar to C, to keep familiarity and to avoid having a steep learning curve.

ADAN was developed by [Lily](https://github.com/transicle), [Kauht](https://github.com/kauht), and [Leo](https://github.com/nvttles).

> [!WARNING]
> This is my ([Lily](https://github.com/transicle)) very first C project, and my second compiler ever written. Optimization to the project will be made over time and as the project expands and more features get added. My previous compiler was written in Rust, but I stopped to try and have fun with manual memory management.

The ADAN language is open for contributions. If you have found a bug and you would like to fix it, or you would like to make optimizations to our code, open a pull request, and it will be reviewed as soon as possible.
