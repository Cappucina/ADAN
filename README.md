## Compiling the Compiler
Before compiling the compiler you need to have each dependency installed first.

> [!NOTE]
> This is only required if you plan on compiling the compiler manually instead of using the pre-compiled compiler binary.

```powershell
$ chmod +x ./dependencies.sh
$ ./dependencies.sh
```
