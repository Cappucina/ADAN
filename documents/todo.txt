TODO
    - Finish Structures
    - Create a CLI tool to compile any `.adn` file

MISSING FEATURES
    - Structs
    - Enums

ISSUES
    - Arrays allow for defining arrays with types separate from the expected type
    - Unsafe with memory (memory leaks)
    - Possible over-allocation for stack memory (stack calculated globally, not per-function)
    - No real registry allocation causing inefficient code generation

IDEAS
    - Either types, for example: `my_var::int || string = 1;`, where it can be either a number or a string
