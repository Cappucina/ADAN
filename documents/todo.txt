TODO
    - Finish Structures.
    - Create a CLI tool to compile any `.adn` file.

MISSING FEATURES
    - Structs.
    - Enums.
    - Proper exiting.

ISSUES
    - Unsafe with memory. (memory leaks)
    - Possible over-allocation for stack memory. (stack calculated globally, not per-function)
    - No real registry allocation causing inefficient code generation.
    
    - Returning on the main function doesn't return and code underneath will execute.

IDEAS
    - Either types, for example: `my_var::int || string = 1;`, where it can be either a number or a string.
