# Adanize

This code folder, is a mirror of the [Adanize](https://github.com/Cappucina/adanize) project, and is a freely available version of it.

This folder is a formalization of ADAN, in Lean with an accompanying paper on how ADAN and Ada itself handles its critical safety and how we captured the essence of safety inside of ADAN. If you wish to contribute to this, please read the file outside of this, calling CONTRIBUTING.md! This will show a more in-depth guide on how to contribute to anything related to the ADAN project. 

## What is a formalization of a programming language?

"In computer science, formal languages are used, among others, as the basis for defining the grammar of programming languages and formalized versions of subsets of natural languages, in which the words of the language represent concepts that are associated with meanings or semantics. In computational complexity theory, decision problems are typically defined as formal languages, and complexity classes are defined as the sets of the formal languages that can be parsed by machines with limited computational power. In logic and the foundations of mathematics, formal languages are used to represent the syntax of axiomatic systems, and mathematical formalism is the philosophy that all of mathematics can be reduced to the syntactic manipulation of formal languages in this way." (“Formal Language”)

## Why?

This project exists to teach people about how ADAN captures the essence of safety, and how your language can aswell with the correct semantics and optimizations.
