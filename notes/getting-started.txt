To get started with ADAN, I want to set a few rules for myself first.

- I want to avoid using AS MUCH artificial intelligence as I possibly can. I must resort to using documentation
and/or viewing (and not using) boilerplate code.
- I want to write down and record this ENTIRE process from start to finish. No edits will be made during
recording and I will be focused for the duration of each session.
- I will ONLY be coding in sessions of 3 hours per day. I must never go beyong this limitation I've set for
myself.

Before I write code, I will hopefully think through everything and make sure all of this makes sense,
and hopefully try and produce the most optimized outcome I can think of.

I will try my best to avoid using artificial intelligence, as previously stated, however, Google search results
tend to force Gemini upon you, and if, for whatever reason I happen to use artificial intelligence, I will
try my best to not use any code provided to me.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before I start coding anything I want to set up some resources that I think will speed up the development
process for ADAN.

DOCKER:
To avoid installing software that the user may not want on their computer, I will instead use a Docker
container. I will also be using Docker to ensure that things are always being ran inside of a Linux environment
so we will have to deal with less cross-platform issues.

The compiler will be ran inside of this container so that way, even on Windows systems, Linux environments are
still being used and we will only be needing to write one script for any platform that is supported with
Docker.

MAKEFILE:
For making commands quickly executable, we will be using Makefile. Although Makefile scripts are primarily used
in C/C++ environments, they should be properly suited in our environment.

We can write a few Makefile commands for base compiling and debugging ADAN.
