I want to try something new in the second version of the language, at least for the lexical analysis stage.
To ensure my lexer is as optimized as-can-be, I will be using a crate for writing functional, efficient, and
practical lexers.

Alongside the new way of doing things, I decided I may slightly change up the syntax to ADAN to make it very
slightly more user-and-developer-friendly.

Aside from explaining that new things will be used for the new lexer, there is not much else to cover.

If you are not aware on what a lexer actually is, or if you've heard of it and want an explanation, read below:

The process of lexical analysis can be broken up into a few very simple concepts:

1. Source code: The way the code is *actually* written, the way YOU see it.
```
const my_var = 2 + 2;
```
2. The process of tokenizing: The process of turning things like "CONST" into their token-equivalents.
```
[
    VAR, SYMBOL("my_var"), EQUALS,
    INT(2), PLUS, INT(2),
    SEMICOLON
]
```

Pretty much, lexical analysis translates ASCII characters ("a") into tokens. (SYMBOL("a"))
