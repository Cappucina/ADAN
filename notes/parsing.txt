The parser is fairly more complex than the lexical analysis process. This is due to us having to handle these
tokens generated by the lexer, then turning that into an abstract syntax tree (AST).

Although the concept of the parsing process is generally simple, it is a little difficult to execute merely
because I don't know where to start...but after figuring it out and getting some base functions set up,
everything SHOULD get a whole lot easier from there.

Parsing is actually REALLY simple. It can be broken up into just a few stages:

1. Identifying what the token you're trying to parse ACTUALLY is.
- This can be done super easily by matching it with the tokens enum previously setup.

2. Creating individual functions for statements, literals, etc.
- We can make things a whole lot easier on us by just separating things into groups. From then on,
we'll handle things together, rather than have a function or piece of logic for literally every token and
every case.

3. Return the output in each function into a branch of the abstract syntax tree (AST).
Doing this is the last stage, finally preparing us for the code generation part. Everything up until the
actual code generation is easy!

Hopefully this helped you understand what a parser does and how it's useful for the process of compiling.
