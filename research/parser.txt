          What Parsing Is and Its Importance to Compiling

Parsing can be understood very simply by knowing it as the stage that
takes in a set of tokens and structures that into an Abstract Syntax
Tree that is formed after your language's syntax rules and restrictions.

The parsing stage is very important to the compilation process due to
its purpose of creating rulesets and organizing tokens in a tree that
we can use to verify how syntaxically accurate our program we've written
is.
