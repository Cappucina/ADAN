	  Understanding Semantic Analysis

Semantic Analysis, otherwise known as type checking,
breaks down and reads the generated AST and makes
sure what the previous stages wrote is actually
accurate and there are no mismatched types or possible
type mismatches. Although typically required when
creating a programming language, you decide how strict
you want your language to be. A lot of languages,
such as Lua, Python, JavaScript, and so on,
use minimal amounts of analysis, and don't stop the
program or really give feedback when the user mismatches
types in their script.
